There was problem connecting this project's branch with JIRA.
Though the TASK no (i.e. MEL-3) was in the name.

it did not got linked with JIRA, as it was a new branch and not the feature branch.


So need to find out
Q1. Only feature branched (that has been created from master branch) can be linked to JIRA.
Q2. if it is a new project it can't be linked to a task in a Epic, it has to be a new task in a EPIC?
Q3. one master branch in GitHub can be linked to with one EPIC?
